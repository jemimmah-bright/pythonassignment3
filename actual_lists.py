# # lists and tuples are all part of data collection
# # they are both orderd
# # lists are mutable and change
# # tuples are presented by (),
# # and lists by []

# #Example
# products = ['pens','penciles','books']
# # QN 
# # add rabber to the products list

# products.append("rabber")
# print(products)

# # insert ruler at the second position

# products.insert(1,"ruler")
# print(products)

# # display the length of the list
# products=len(products)
# print (products)

# #tuple

# tuple_colors = ("yellow", "Green")
# # add purple to the list
# tuple_colors.append("purple")
# print (tuple_colors)

# # how to modify a tuple is by converting it to a list
# #CONVERT
# tuple_colors = ("yellow", "Green")
# new_tuple = list(colors)


fruits =("apple",)
print(fruits,type(fruits))  # when ever a tupple has one item its type is a sting but to make it a tupple
                            #we all a comma at the end
